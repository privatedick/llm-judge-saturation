Axiom audit — the machine-checked backing for this repo's "0 sorry" claim.
=========================================================================

`lake build` alone does NOT establish "0 sorry": Lean emits `declaration uses
'sorry'` as a *warning* and still exits 0. A line-anchored `grep '^\s*sorry'`
does not establish it either — it misses `exact sorry`, `:= sorry`, and
`<;> sorry`. Both gaps were demonstrated before this file was written.

This module closes both. It walks every declaration that this repository's own
modules (`EvoEcos*`) contribute to the environment, collects the axioms each one
transitively depends on, and fails elaboration — and therefore `lake build`, and
therefore CI — if any axiom outside Lean's three standard ones shows up.

That single check subsumes what the old grep was trying to do and more:

  * `sorry` anywhere, in any syntactic position, surfaces as `sorryAx`;
  * an `axiom` command added to this repo surfaces as its own name.

It is also self-maintaining: a theorem added tomorrow is audited without anyone
remembering to list it here.

What it deliberately does NOT claim: the three axioms below are permitted, since
they are Lean's standard classical foundation and essentially all of Mathlib
depends on them. "0 axiom" in this repo means "no repo-declared axiom and no
`sorryAx`", not "no axioms at all" — see README.
